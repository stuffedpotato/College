###### This project is an assignment that I completed for my Object-Oriented Programming in Java class at Langara.

## College, Student, GraduateStudent, InternationalStudent & CollegeTester

- The College class utilizes the Student class in my other project by creating an array list of Student objects.
- This project helped me understand inheritance, polymorphism and hierarchy of classes. We used Student as our parent/super class and GraduateStudent & InternationalStudent are the children classes.
- I have also used Exceptions in this project to catch invalid input errors.

The user has the following options that allow testing of all available methods in the College class:
1. Add a student (addStudent) where a student can be a domestic student, a graduate student or an international student.
2. Search for a student (searchStudent).
3. Remove a student (deleteStudent).
4. Add course information for a student (addCourse).
5. Access a student's login ID (getLoginID).
6. Find the student with the highest GPA (getHighestGPA).
7. Print all the students in Langara (toString).

<code>langara</code> is the object created of the College class and is used to manipulate the Student objects.
